## About Nomade Rover Project
Nomade Rover is an advanced ROS 2 package designed for ROS 2 Foxy and above. It simulates and controls a tactical 4WD robotic platform equipped with perception modules (2D LiDAR, camera, etc.), autonomous navigation, and AI-powered detection (YOLOv8).

The package enables Gazebo simulation, RViz visualization, and YOLO-based object detection â€” perfect for prototyping smart surveillance, tactical mobility, and AI-enhanced robotics.

## Features

* 4WD tactical rover with realistic physics (Ackermann-based mobility)

* Integrated camera for vision and detection

* 2D LiDAR for SLAM, obstacle avoidance, and perception

* Object detection using YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)

* RViz integration for robot state and sensor visualization

* Modular and extendable launch files

* CAN-based assisted steering (real hardware in future phase)

* Robot control via internet 




## Installation

Create project directory

```bash
  mkdir -p ~/mazen_ws/src cd ~/mazen_ws/src
```

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mazen-daghari/Mazen_4dw.git
```

Build project

```bash
 colcon build --symlink-install
```

Source project

```bash
  source install/setup.bash 
```

Launch Gazebo simulation
```bash
  ros2 launch mazen_mac1 gazebo_model.launch.py
  ```
Launch Yolo v8
``` bash
  ros2 launch recognition launch_yolov8.launch.py
```
## Roadmap


 * Build URDF of Nomade Rover

 * Integrate RGB camera , Depth camera , 2D lidar , 3d lidar, and IMU 

 * Add Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion

 * Integrate YOLOv8 with simulation

 * Add real-time CAN-based control interface

 * Deploy on hardware with ESP32 + Jetson
## Acknowledgements



* Ultralytics YOLOv8

* Gazebo

* ROS 2 & Nav2 Community
## Notes


* Make sure all dependencies (e.g., YOLOv8, camera drivers, etc.) are correctly installed.

* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS 2 Foxy. Later ROS 2 versions like Humble and Iron should also work with minor adjustments.

- Copy models (e.g., person, SUV, stop sign, bus) to your ~/.gazebo/models directory. This step is only required once. (Note: This directory may be hidden; enable 'show hidden files' if needed).


* The Gazebo simulation and the recognition package must be executed simultaneously. This requires initiating their respective launch files in distinct terminal instances.
